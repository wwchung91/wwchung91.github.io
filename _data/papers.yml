  summary: We propose a robotic system that integrates computer vision, spatial mapping, and natural language processing. The system constructs semantic location maps from camera and sensor data, interprets user speech through a reasoning engine, and autonomously executes commands while providing real-time feedback.

  summary: Extended the proposed two-stage framework for moving object detection in a non-stationary camera. The background regulation method integrates frame differencing, optical flow, and foreground detection history to mitigate inaccurate motion compensation of the background models. The foreground detection process uses a sampling mask computed from a foreground probability map to identify regions with a high likelihood of being foreground. Iterative threshold refinement is then performed only within these regions, reducing overall computation while improving speed and efficiency.

- organization: A Two-Stage Foreground Propagation for Moving Object Detection in a Non-Stationary Camera (AVSS)

  summary: Proposed and implemented a two-stage framework for moving object detection in a non-stationary camera. The first stage incorporates a background regulation method that uses clues from frame differencing and prior foreground detection from background subtraction to mitigate the inaccurate motion compensation on the background models. The second stage selects areas with high foreground probability as anchors and iteratively lowers the threshold around the anchors, distinguishing true foreground regions from noise. This approach achieved significantly higher recall while maintaining strong precision, establishing state-of-the-art performance at the time.


#- organization: Fast and Accurate Car Detection in Drone-View (ICCE-Asia)
#  role: Jongmin Yoon, InHan Kim, WonTaek Chung, Daijin Kim
#  year: 2016
#  url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7804775
#  summary:  We propose a way to detect cars in drone-view fast and accurately. For this purpose we proposes a feature called G-ORF for effective feature description. Also we designed a pose classifier and bin-specific weighted Linear Discriminant Analysis (wLDA) classifier for pose classification.

  summary: This paper introduces TalkBack, an online forum designed to help children critically evaluate food advertisements by reflecting on ad claims, product healthiness, and personal desire. TalkBack was created to explore how technology helps children develop these skills. A study with twenty-eight students in a summer camp program showed that children often projected and protected their sense of identity through their forum interactions. We also highlight the limited analytic depth in students’ forum posts and outline opportunities for HCI research to better foster critical thinking and healthier decision-making in adolescents.
