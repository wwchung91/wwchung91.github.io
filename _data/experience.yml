      - name: Gretchen Humanoid Robot Head with a 3D Camera
        summary: <strong> [Developer] </strong> Created an open-source robot head research platform with a 3D camera. Developed a software framework with ROS to control the motor, estimate headpose, detect objects, and estimate the position of the objects in robot coordinates system. The Gretchen Humanoid Robot Head was intended to support AIBrain's conversational AI by implementing social gaze. The robot gathers environmental knowledge by creating a map of the objects in the environment. It estimates the gaze direction of the user and does a simple analysis of the conversation to determine head motion behavior.
        skills: <strong> [Required Skillset] </strong> ROS, C++, Python, Fusion360, Cura
        #Developed both hardware and software. For the hardware, 2D or 3D camera was used with Robotis motors. For the software ROS was used to control the motors and estimate positions of objects in robot coordinates system. The software also includes remote control of the robot head.

      - name: Sensoriboard/Sensorimotor
        summary: <strong> [Team Member] </strong> Sensoriboard is a board that is connected to a motor and allows motor control to be customized. The main aim of the sensoriboard is to reduce the cost of servo motors while also making the motors fully customizable. Assuming the sensoriboards were mass produced, the price is reduced significantly. The problem of sensoriboards were that everything had to be developed from scratch making it very hard to use and prone to inaccurate motor movement. Initially, the sensoriboards/sensorimotors were used in the Gretchen robot.

    - name: Moving object detection in a non-stationary camera
      summary: <strong> [Researcher] </strong> Developed a moving object detection on a non-stationary camera using grid-based background subtraction. Algorithm involves motion compensation of the background model and subtracting the motion compensated background model with the current image to detect the foreground. Suggested a clue-based background model regulation to decrease the noise detected as foreground and an iterative thresholding methodology to use regions with higher probabilities of being a foreground as anchors to detect foreground. Involved in creating a new dataset for foreground detection on a non-stationary camera. Achieved state-of-the-art in 2016.
