      - name: Gretchen Humanoid AI Online Course
        summary: <strong> [Instructor] </strong> Based on the Gretchen robot head with a 2D camera, we created a online course that helps people get interested in robotics and programming a robotic head. After the course, students should be able to program a functional robot head. Users are exposed to various level of programming such as commanding actuators or applying computer vision algorithms. We also developed a social gaze framework as an exemplar and to enhance  AIBrain's conversational AI called AICoRE

  summary: Worked on government projects involved with computer vision, machine learning and surveillance.
  projects:
    - name: Moving object detection in a non-stationary camera
      summary: <strong> [Researcher] </strong> Developed a moving object detection on a non-stationary camera using grid-based background subtraction. Algorithm involves motion compensation of the background model and subtracting the motion compensated background model with the current image to detect the foreground. Suggested a clue-based background model regulation to decrease the noise detected as foreground. Involved in creating a new dataset for foreground detection on a non-stationary camera. Achieved state-of-the-art in 2016.
