# VP of Global Communications
- company: AIBrain Asia & Crosscert
  position: Product Manager/Software Engineer
  duration: Present &mdash; 2016
  summary: <strong>Summary</strong> Managed and developed on robotics products that include computer vision, machine learning, and conversational AI. Mainly focused on creating a open-sourced humanoid platform.
  projects:
      - name: Gretchen Robot Head
        summary: <strong> [Developer] </strong> Created an open-source robot head research platform. Developed both hardware and software. For the hardware, 2D or 3D camera was used with Robotis motors. For the software ROS was used to control the motors and estimate positions of objects in robot coordinates system. The software also includes remote control of the robot head.

      - name: Gretchen Humanoid AI Online Course
        summary: <strong> [Instructor] </strong> Based on the Gretchen robot head with a 2D camera, we created a online course that helps people get interested in robotics and programming a robotic head. After the course, students should be able to program a functional robot head. Users are exposed to various level of programming such as commanding actuators or applying computer vision algorithms. We also developed a social gaze framework as an exemplar and to enhance  AIBrain's conversational AI called AICoRE

# Director of Digital Stratgy
- company: Pohang University of Science and Technology
  position: Researcher
  duration:  2016 &mdash; 2014
  summary: Worked on government projects involved with computer vision, machine learning and surveillance.
  projects:
    - name: Moving object detection in a non-stationary camera
      summary: <strong> [Researcher] </strong> Developed a moving object detection on a non-stationary camera using grid-based background subtraction. Algorithm involves motion compensation of the background model and subtracting the motion compensated background model with the current image to detect the foreground. Suggested a clue-based background model regulation to decrease the noise detected as foreground. Involved in creating a new dataset for foreground detection on a non-stationary camera. Achieved state-of-the-art in 2016.
